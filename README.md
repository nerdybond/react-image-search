## React Image Search

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m @nerdybond. This is an experimental project, imitating the website Pexel's and using their API to generate a map of images, titles, and artist information.

## Development

If you'd like to run this project locally, clone the repo and then:

1. yarn install (or npm install) to install dependencies
2. yarn start (or npm start) to preview the app locally
3. yarn test (or npm test) to run the tests
